    You are taken to a serene, mountain-side environment free of distractions and the stresses of everyday life. As soft, calming music plays in the background, your instructor greets you and asks you what to do. You can just do tai-chi, shavasana, or have the full experience (both tai-chi and shavasana). If tai-chi is chosen, shadow puppets of the instructor materializes in all four of your cardinal directions. This gives you a full 360 degree view of how movements should be done and what it should look life. As for the shavasana, the world dims to starlight and a voice encourages you to close your eyes. Now, this applications turns into an audio experience where the voice of the instructor guides you through deep breathing exercises and snaps you back from any mental distractions. As shavasana ends, the world will slowly shift back to daylight again.

    <h2> Demo </h2>
    <i>Welcome to Tea Chi Tai Chi. Tai Chi originated as a martial art, tracing its roots back to the Henan province of central China in 1580. There are five main styles of tai chi which have developed over the centuries. While still practiced as a martial art, in the modern world it is more widespread as a gentle form of exercise that can help maintain strength, flexibility, and balance.</i>

<h2> Functionality</h2>

Our product is a fully functional virtual reality application a baseline level. The user will be able to experience the educational benefits through this Tai-Chi introduction. They will begin with an audio intro to learn the history of Tai-Chi and then proceed to use their bodies to move into martial art positions. As a supplement to the virtual world, they will then take off their headsets and meditate upon what they learned.

<h2> Design Process</h2>

Our ultimate goal is to overlay shadow hands and feet on top of your own for you to follow. Given the time that we have, however, we sought alternatives that were more realistic and in-tune with our abilities. Thus, we thought of incorporating a 3D model of our tai-chi instructor into the application itself. We would use the XBox kinetic and record his movements in real time. With that data, we would overlay a dummy instructor body on top of the skeleton body and place him on a rotating platform in the environment. The reasoning behind this rotating platform is so that the user can always see the instructor no matter which way he or she turns. However, we decided to forego this idea as it would be rather awkward for the instructor to be moving around you without his movements matching his displacement.
<br>
After conducting an informational interview with our local expert, we decided upon placing a copy of the instructor to all four of your coordinate directions. Such layout would stimulate a tai chi class setting where others are practicing alongside you. To judge how closely your own actions are to the instructors&#39;, you see a model of your own body to your front right. Thanks to the Kinetic, this model will move with your body in real time.

<h2> Development Process </h2>

There are two parts to our development process: Animation and Environment.
<ol>
  <li>The Animation development started with integrating the <a href="http://www.imaginativeuniversal.com/blog/2015/03/27/unity-5-and-kinect-2-integration/">Kinect for Windows 2</a> library. We used it to track the locations of one's body joints with the Kinect, which we then mapped to a humanoid in Unity. Using the Oculus' trigger, you can move this body around. We then added a recording feature in which we serialize the various data structures (Skeleton, Joint, etc.) so that we can save the joint locations and use it to control the instructor's body in future runs. We also used Wwise to include the audio that we produced.</li>
  <li>The Environment development consists of 'drawing' a VR context using Tiltbrush for the student to practice tai-chi in. This was iterated several times with the goal of maximizing visual clarity and boosting atmospherics. The Tiltbrush suite offered several readymade tools for this task. We considered using Unity's own environmental rendering capabilities in conjunction with external 3D modeling programs - as was the case with the development of the Sea Turtle project - but decided on Tiltbrush for its calligraphic style. While this has certain drawbacks - namely, none of the assets are volumes - the 'brush' look was sufficiently distanced from the VR user that their appearance as atmospheric objects was sufficient for the task.</li>

<hr><h1 id="concluson"> Conclusion </h1>

We hope that our product can play an instrumental role in shaping health education of the future. In addition to physical wellbeing, mental health is an important aspect of self care. According to the Mental Health Foundation, “Mental health problems affect about 1 and 10 children and young people.” Therefore, through our VR implementation into education systems, our goal is to disintegrate the stigma around mental health and supply positive coping mechanisms for adolescents.

<hr><h1 id="related"> Related Work </h1>

<p>Other projects such as Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s <q>Training for Physical Tasks in Virtual Environments</q> have experimented in the field of meditative VR. Their product used Tai Chi to improve full body motor tasks. However, in order to accomplish this they needed the user to wear both a headset and a belt around their waist. Therefore, this inhibited some of the user&#39;s freedom.</p>
